COVID-19 can be diagnosed similarly to other conditions caused by viral infections: using a blood, saliva, or tissue sample. However, most tests use a cotton swab to retrieve a sample from the inside of your nostrils.</li>

<li style="color:skyblue;font-family:verdana">
The CDC, some state health departments, and some commercial companies conduct tests. See your state’s health department websiteTrusted Source to find out where testing is offered near you.</li>

<li style="color:skyblue;font-family:verdana">
On April 21, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)Trusted Source approved the use of the first COVID-19 home testing kit.
Using the cotton swab provided, people will be able to collect a nasal sample and mail it to a designated laboratory for testing.
The emergency-use authorization specifies that the test kit is authorized for use by people whom healthcare professionals have identified as having suspected COVID-19.
Talk to your doctor right away if you think you have COVID-19 or you notice symptoms.
Your doctor will advise you on whether you should:
stay home and monitor your symptoms
come into the doctor’s office to be evaluated
go to the hospital for more urgent care

In difficult times, you need to be able to turn to experts who understand and can help strengthen your mental well-being. We’re here for you.</li>

<p style="color:skyblue;font-family:verdana">What treatments are available?</p>

<li style="color:skyblue;font-family:verdana">
There’s currently no treatment specifically approved for COVID-19, and no cure for an infection, although treatments and vaccines are currently under study.
Instead, treatment focuses on managing symptoms as the virus runs its course.
Seek medical help if you think you have COVID-19. Your doctor will recommend treatment for any symptoms or complications that develop and let you know if you need to seek emergency treatment.</li>

<li style="color:skyblue;font-family:verdana">
Other coronaviruses like SARS and MERS are also treated by managing symptoms. In some cases, experimental treatments are tested to see how effective they are.</li>

<li style="color:skyblue;font-family:verdana">
Examples of therapies used for these illnesses include:</li>

<ul>
<li style="color:skyblue;font-family:verdana">antiviral or retroviral medications</li>
<li style="color:skyblue;font-family:verdana">breathing support, such as mechanical ventilation</li>
<li style="color:skyblue;font-family:verdana">steroids to reduce lung swelling</li>
<li style="color:skyblue;font-family:verdana">blood plasma transfusions</li>
<li style="color:skyblue;font-family:verdana">What are the possible complications from COVID-19?</li>
</ul>

<li style="color:skyblue;font-family:verdana">
The most serious complication of COVID-19 is a type of pneumonia that’s been called 2019 novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia (NCIP).</li>

<li style="color:skyblue;font-family:verdana">
Results from a 2020 study of 138 people admitted into hospitals in Wuhan, China, with NCIP, found that 26 percent of those admitted had severe cases and needed to be treated in the intensive care unit (ICU).</li>

<li style="color:skyblue;font-family:verdana">
About 4.3 percent of the people who were admitted to the ICU died from this type of pneumonia.
It should be noted that people who were admitted to the ICU were on average older and had more underlying health conditions than people who didn’t go to the ICU.</li>

<li style="color:skyblue;font-family:verdana">
So far, NCIP is the only complication specifically linked to the 2019 coronavirus. Researchers have seen the following complications in people who have developed COVID-19:</li>

<ul>
<li style="color:skyblue;font-family:verdana">acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)</li>
<li style="color:skyblue;font-family:verdana">irregular heart rate (arrhythmia)</li>
<li style="color:skyblue;font-family:verdana">cardiovascular shock</li>
<li style="color:skyblue;font-family:verdana">severe muscle pain (myalgia)</li>
<li style="color:skyblue;font-family:verdana">fatigue</li>
<li style="color:skyblue;font-family:verdana">heart damage or heart attack</li>
</ul>

<p style="color:skyblue;font-family:verdana">How can you prevent coronaviruses?</p>
<li style="color:skyblue;font-family:verdana">
The best way to prevent the transmission of infection is to avoid or limit contact with people who are showing symptoms of COVID-19 or any respiratory infection.
The next best thing you can do is practice good hygiene and physical distancing to prevent bacteria and viruses from being transmitted.</li>

<p style="color:skyblue;font-family:verdana">Prevention tips:-</p>
<li style="color:skyblue;font-family:verdana">
Wash your hands frequently for at least 20 seconds at a time with warm water and soap. How long is 20 seconds? About as long as it takes to sing your “ABCs.”</li>

<li style="color:skyblue;font-family:verdana">
Don’t touch your face, eyes, nose, or mouth when your hands are dirty.</li>

<li style="color:skyblue;font-family:verdana">
Don’t go out if you’re feeling sick or have any cold or flu symptoms.</li>

<li style="color:skyblue;font-family:verdana">
Stay at least 6 feetTrusted Source (2 meters) away from people.</li>

<li style="color:skyblue;font-family:verdana">
Cover your mouth with a tissue or the inside of your elbow whenever you sneeze or cough. Throw away any tissues you use right away.</li>

<li style="color:skyblue;font-family:verdana">
Clean any objects you touch a lot. Use disinfectants on objects like phones, computers, and doorknobs. Use soap and water for objects that you cook or eat with, like utensils and dishware.</li>

<p style="color:skyblue;font-family:verdana">Should you wear a mask?</p>
<li style="color:skyblue;font-family:verdana">
If you’re out in a public setting where it’s difficult to follow physical distancing guidelines, the CDCTrusted Source recommends that you wear a cloth face mask that covers your mouth and nose.</li>

<li style="color:skyblue;font-family:verdana">
When worn correctly, and by large percentages of the public, these masks can help to slow the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
That’s because they can block the respiratory droplets of people who may be asymptomatic or people who have the virus but have gone undiagnosed.</li>

<li style="color:skyblue;font-family:verdana">
Respiratory droplets get into the air when you:</li>

<ul>

<li style="color:skyblue;font-family:verdana">exhale</li>
<li style="color:skyblue;font-family:verdana">talk</li>
<li style="color:skyblue;font-family:verdana">cough</li>
<li style="color:skyblue;font-family:verdana">sneeze</li>

</ul>

<p style="color:skyblue;font-family:verdana">You can make your own mask using basic materials such as:</p>

<li style="color:skyblue;font-family:verdana">a bandana</li>
<li style="color:skyblue;font-family:verdana">a T-shirt</li>
<li style="color:skyblue;font-family:verdana">cotton fabric</li>

<li style="color:skyblue;font-family:verdana">
The CDC provides instructionsTrusted Source for making a mask with scissors or with a sewing machine.</li>

<li style="color:skyblue;font-family:verdana">
Cloth masks are preferred for the general public since other types of masks should be reserved for healthcare workers.</li>

<li style="color:skyblue;font-family:verdana">
It’s critical to keep the mask clean. Wash it each time you use it. Avoid touching the front of it with your hands. Also, try to avoid touching your mouth, nose, and eyes when you remove it.</li>

<li style="color:skyblue;font-family:verdana">
This prevents you from possibly transferring the virus from a mask to your hands and from your hands to your face.</li>

<li style="color:skyblue;font-family:verdana">
Keep in mind that wearing a mask isn’t a replacement for other preventive measures, such as frequent handwashing and practicing physical distancing. All of them are important.</li>

<p style="color:skyblue;font-family:verdana">Certain people shouldn’t wear face masks, including:</p>

<li style="color:skyblue;font-family:verdana">children under 2 years old</li>
<li style="color:skyblue;font-family:verdana">people who have trouble breathing</li>
<li style="color:skyblue;font-family:verdana">people who are unable to remove their own masks</li>
