<li style="color:skyblue;font-family:verdana">
Signs and symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may appear two to 14 days after exposure. This time after exposure and before having symptoms is called the incubation period.</li>


<li style="color:skyblue;font-family:verdana">Common signs and symptoms can include:

<ul>

<li style="color:skyblue;font-family:verdana">Fever</li>
<li style="color:skyblue;font-family:verdana">Cough</li>
<li style="color:skyblue;font-family:verdana">Tiredness</li>

</ul>


<li style="color:skyblue;font-family:verdana">Other symptoms can include:-</li>

<ul>

<li style="color:skyblue;font-family:verdana">Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing</li>
<li style="color:skyblue;font-family:verdana">Muscle aches</li>
<li style="color:skyblue;font-family:verdana">Chills</li>
<li style="color:skyblue;font-family:verdana">Sore throat</li>
<li style="color:skyblue;font-family:verdana">Loss of taste or smell</li>
<li style="color:skyblue;font-family:verdana">Headache</li>
<li style="color:skyblue;font-family:verdana">Chest pain</li>


</ul>

<li style="color:skyblue;font-family:verdana">
This list is not all inclusive. Other less common symptoms have been reported, such as rash, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. Children have similar symptoms to adults and generally have mild illness.</li>

<li style="color:skyblue;font-family:verdana">
The severity of COVID-19 symptoms can range from very mild to severe. Some people may have only a few symptoms, and some people may have no symptoms at all. People who are older or who have existing chronic medical conditions, such as heart disease, lung disease, diabetes, severe obesity, chronic kidney or liver disease, or who have compromised immune systems may be at higher risk of serious illness. This is similar to what is seen with other respiratory illnesses, such as influenza.</li>

<li style="color:skyblue;font-family:verdana">
Some people may experience worsened symptoms, such as worsened shortness of breath and pneumonia, about a week after symptoms start.</li>

<p style="color:skyblue;font-family:verdana">
<b><u>Causes</b></u>:-</p>
<li style="color:skyblue;font-family:verdana">
Infection with the new coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, or SARS-CoV-2) causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).</li>

<li style="color:skyblue;font-family:verdana">
The virus appears to spread easily among people, and more continues to be discovered over time about how it spreads. Data has shown that it spreads from person to person among those in close contact (within about 6 feet, or 2 meters). The virus spreads by respiratory droplets released when someone with the virus coughs, sneezes or talks. These droplets can be inhaled or land in the mouth or nose of a person nearby.</li>

<li style="color:skyblue;font-family:verdana">
It can also spread if a person touches a surface with the virus on it and then touches his or her mouth, nose or eyes, although this isn't considered to be a main way it spreads.</li>

<p style="color:skyblue;font-family:verdana">
<b><u>Complications</b></u>:-</p>

<li style="color:skyblue;font-family:verdana">
Although most people with COVID-19 have mild to moderate symptoms, the disease can cause severe medical complications and lead to death in some people. Older adults or people with existing chronic medical conditions are at greater risk of becoming seriously ill with COVID-19.</li>

<li style="color:skyblue;font-family:verdana">
Complications can include:</li>
<ul>
<li style="color:skyblue;font-family:verdana">Pneumonia and trouble breathing</li>
<li style="color:skyblue;font-family:verdana">Organ failure in several organs</li>
<li style="color:skyblue;font-family:verdana">Heart problems</li>
<li style="color:skyblue;font-family:verdana">
A severe lung condition that causes a low amount of oxygen to go through your bloodstream to your organs (acute respiratory distress syndrome)</li>
<li style="color:skyblue;font-family:verdana">Blood clots</li>
<li style="color:skyblue;font-family:verdana">Acute kidney injury</li>
<li style="color:skyblue;font-family:verdana">Additional viral and bacterial infections</li>
